        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Note: Kewayy is a Work in Progress</p>
        <p>I was inspired to create this project at work because we were using Google Docs and Google Sheets to do our QA testing. While those give you lots of freedom, having some restrictions with added functionality would greatly improve productivity. I was interested in learning Django because it has many useful features to expedite the creation of data-driven websites. I also like using Python... This project has been a great experience so far, and I look forward to continuing working on it.</p>
        <p>I learned from work that using a board with Todo, Working On, and Done would benefit the project. I has allowed me to capture ideas of features I want to add. It has also kept my mind in check, reminding me of how much progress has been made.</p>

        <h2>Planning</h2>
        <p>From previous projects, I have learned that planning is a crucial step in the software development process. For this project I planned out database model, URL mappings, and basic UI designs.</p>

        <h3>Database Model</h3>
